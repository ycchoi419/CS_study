# 03 Multiplexing

## Transmission Delay

- Transmission delay

  - time to completely transmitting a certain amount of data

  - As bandwidth of link C gets larger(large bandwidth = data rate), then the gap between two bits becomes smaller
  - Transmission delay = D/C, where D is the is the message size



## Propagation Delay

- Propagation Delay
  - 신호가 travelling 하는 데 걸리는 시간
  - time required to travel from the transmitter to the receiver
  - d/L where
    - d: distance between the transmitter to the receiver
    - L: Speed of electromagnetic signal (=light speed)



## High Speed Network

- Network with large bandwidth
  - Decrease transmission delay
  - Not propagation speed
- Multimedia communications & High Speed Network



## Multiplexing

- Multiplexing
  - Set of techniques allowing simultaneous transmission of multiple signals across a single data link
  - Channel : protion of a link that carries a transmission between a given pair of sender & receiver
    - A link with n channels supports n simultaneous communications
- Demultiplexing
  - Separation of combined signals
- Categories of Multiplexing
  - Frequency-division multiplexing(FDM)
    - 아날로그 통신에 많이 사용됨
  - Time-division multiplexing(TDM)
    - 디지털 통신에 사용됨
    - Synchronous, Asynchronous로 나뉨
  - Wave-division multiplexing(WDM)



## Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM)

- Analog communication technique
- A medium (link) can support bandwidth (BW) much larger than each individual requires
  - A co-axial cable supports a few Mhz while a voice BW is 20 KHz
- Signals generated by each sender modulate different carrier frequency
- Guard Band
  - Unused bandwidth separating channels



## Synchronous TDM (STDM)

- Digital transmission system
- Frame
  - Time is partitioned into small, equal interval called (time) slot each of which is dedicated to a one sending device
  - Frame : One complete cycle of time slots
  - Multiplexer allocates exactly the same time slot to each sender at all times, whether or not the sender has anything to transmit
- Demultiplexing
  - Based on slot position



## Asynchronous TDM

- Disadvantage of Synchronous TDM
  - Possible to waste capacity of line
- Demultiplexing is theproblem
  - Should specify who (sender) sends to whom (receiver)
- Addressing and Overhead
  - Specify the destination ID (address, port, ...) in a head
  - In addition, layer 2/3 header usually contains
    - Message size
    - Source address
    - Slot boundary
    - ...
