## Protocol

- Protocol

  - Rules that communicating entities should abide to understand and properly process messages received

  - 서로 다른 OS나 프로그램을 사용하더라도 두 디바이스 간에 커뮤니케이션이 가능해야 함

- Note that communication is exchanges of messages

  - Protocol specifies the meaning (semantics) and syntax of message
  - And timing of messages

- Error dectection
  - Communication links are not 100% reliable
  - Errors may change, add, delete bits in the original message
- How do you  detect errors?
  - There ar e many solutions
    - Parity bit
    - One's complement addition
    - CRC

- We need to agree
  - Use the same method
  - How to apply the method
  - How to represent additional data
- Assume we agreed to
  - Even parity bit
    -  1 갯수가 짝수이면 0, 홀수이면 1
  - Apply parity to every bytes
  - Attach parity bits to the end of the original message as a byte stream



## Protocol Principle

- Protocol Principle
  - Message that layer n generates at the sender = Message that layer n receives at the receiver
- Good protocols abide the protocol principle



## Virtual Communication

- Two layer entities at the same level think they communicate directly
- In fact, a message goes down and up lower layers at the sender and the receiver



## Standard Protocols

- To communicate, should use the same protocol
- Proprietary protocols
  - Created (usually) by one or more companies
  - Closed protocol
    - Protocol is hidden or the owner may claim IPR
- Open protocol
  - Specifications are open to the public and everyone can use free
- Standard protocol
  - Open protocol that many agree to use
- Examples of standard Protocols
  - ISO OSI
  - IEEE LAN, WLAN, ...
  - TCP/IP
  - ...
